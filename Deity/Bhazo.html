	<h2 class="title">Lore/Notes</h2>
		He was born a demi-God and wished for more knowledge so he could become more powerful and eventually find a way to become a full-blown god. Sensing his greed, the gods tricked him by giving him the knowledge without giving him the means to handle this much knowledge. His half-divine brain was unable to handle the load and it turned him insane. The gods further punished him by hanging him above an active volcano, where due to his nature, he wouldn't die but he would live forever in a half-dying agonizing state.
		People can travel up a dangerous trek into a forboding cave to witness this sight and ask the insane being questions that he will give cryptic answers to. They will generally be true but it might take one too long to figure out the meaning in his statements.
