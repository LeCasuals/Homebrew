	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Evangelist">Evangelist</a></h3>
	<b>1: Family's Bond (Sp)</b> <i>cure light wounds </i>3/day, <i>shield other </i>2/day, or <i>prayer </i>1/day<br />
	<b>2: Twin Fang (Ex)</b> Once per day as a standard action, you can summon an exact double of your animal companion. The double acts and thinks like your animal companion in every way, and obeys your commands just as the original would. Your original animal companion and its double understand and trust each other perfectly. The double remains for 1 round for every Hit Die you possess, and then vanishes. If you don’t have an animal companion, you instead gain the ability to use <i>summon nature’s ally V</i> as a spell-like ability once per day.<br />
	<b>3: Faithful Archer (Ex)</b> You are particularly skilled at using Erastil’s favored weapon. When using a longbow, you add your Wisdom bonus on attack and damage rolls against targets within 30 feet.
	
	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Exalted">Exalted</a></h3>
	<b>1: Animal Friend (Sp)</b> <i>charm animal </i>3/day, <i>animal messenger </i>2/day, or <i>summon nature’s ally III </i>1/day<br />
	<b>2: Hunter's Ally (Sp)</b> Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a pair of hound archons. The hound archons follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to their home in Heaven. The hound archons don’t follow commands that would violate their lawful good alignment. Such commands will not only earn refusal and scorn from the hound archons, but could cause them to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.<br />
	<b>3: Communal Table (Sp)</b> Your devotion to caring for your community allows you to evoke Erastil’s divine bounty to feed your friends with a banquet of cooked game and simple beverages. Once per day, you can use heroes’ feast as a spell-like ability. Creatures that eat from this communal table, a process that takes 1 hour, gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and Will saving throws instead of the usual +1 morale bonus. Whenever you cast this spell, choose one teamwork feat; you may select a new feat every time you cast this spell, but once it’s cast, your selection can’t be changed. Anyone who eats from the communal table gains the benefits of the chosen teamwork feat. The benefits of the heroes’ feast, including the bonus teamwork feat, last for 12 hours. A character doesn’t need to meet the prerequisites for a teamwork feat granted through this ability.
	
	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sentinel">Sentinel</a></h3>
	<b>1: Sureshot (Sp)</b> <i>longshot</i><sup>UC</sup> 3/day, <i>deadeye’s arrow </i>2/day, or <i>flame arrow </i>1/day<br />
	<b>2: Tough Hide (Su)</b> When you wear armor made from leather or animal hide, the armor provides an extra +2 armor bonus to your AC. This bonus improves the normal armor bonus granted by the armor; in other words, it stacks with the suit’s normal armor bonus. You also mystically subsume some of the qualities of the animal that gave its life for the armor. Gain the scent ability with a range of 30 feet while wearing armor made from leather or animal hide.<br />
	<b>3: Farmer's Bond (Su)</b> Your time spent cultivating crops has given you a bond with plants. You can cast <i>speak with plants </i>3 times per day. If you spend at least 1 hour during the day in direct sunlight, you don’t need to eat that day. Finally, you become immune to poisons ingested from whole plants (not distilled poisons, such as assassins use) and any poison from attacks or effects generated by plant creatures.

	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Demoniac">Demoniac</a></h3>
	<b>1: Lunatic’s Gift (Sp)</b> <i>lesser confusion </i>3/day, <i>touch of idiocy </i>2/day, or <i>summon monster III </i>1/day<br />
	<b>2: Teratoma (Ex)</b> You gain a beneficial deformity. Generally, this deformity manifests as a tentacle, tail, claw, or bite that grants you a secondary natural attack dealing 1d6 (1d4 for Small creatures) points of damage. You gain an additional ability depending on the attack chosen as well—this ability can be chosen from the following special attacks: bleed 3, grab, trip, or a 5-foot increase to reach with the natural attack.<br />
	<b>3: Third Eye (Su)</b> A third eye opens in your forehead. This eye grants you darkvision to a range of 60 feet (if you already have darkvision, it extends the range of your darkvision by 60 feet) and a +4 profane bonus on Perception checks. Three times per day, you may use a gaze attack that lasts for 1 round; activating this gaze attack is a swift action. This gaze attack has a range of 30 feet, and drives those who fail to resist its effects with a Will save permanently insane, as per the spell <i>insanity </i>(save DC equals 10 + half your HD + your Charisma modifier).
	
	<h2 class="title">Boons - <a href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fiendish%20Obedience">Fiendish Obedience</a></h2>
	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Evangelist">Evangelist</a></h3>
	<b>1: Pitiless Judgment (Sp)</b> <i>wrath </i> 3/day, <i>flames of the faithful</i> 2/day, or <i>bestow curse</i> 1/day<br />
	<b>2: Tireless Judgment (Ex)</b> You gain Favored Judgment as a bonus feat, choosing chaotic outsider, good outsider, or a subtype of humanoid. If you don’t have the judgment class feature, you instead gain a +4 profane bonus on Survival checks to track a creature or individual of this type. This boon doesn’t grant you any ranks in the Survival skill; therefore, if you have no ranks, you still can follow tracks only if the DC of the task is 10 or lower.<br />
	<b>3: Resounding Judgment (Sp)</b> Once per day, you can channel the effects of <i>resounding blow</i> through your weapon, though you don’t need to cast (or even know) the spell. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll for the attack. On a hit, the target is affected as if you had cast <i>resounding blow</i> before your attack, and the surrounding area rings with the sound of vicious, booming laughter. You don’t gain the stunning effect of the spell unless you have access to the judgment or smite ability. If your attack misses, the resounding blow effect is wasted.
	
	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Exalted">Exalted</a></h3>
	<b>1: Darkfire (Sp)</b> <i>burning hands </i> 3/day, <i>darkness</i> 2/day, or <i>deeper darkness</i> 1/day<br />
	<b>2: Embersight (Su)</b> Your eyes take on the appearance of red-hot, glowing embers, granting you the ability to see in darkness much like devils. You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you chose either darkness or deeper darkness as the spell-like ability granted by your first boon, you can also see perfectly through both darkness and deeper darkness. If you already have darkvision to a range of 60 feet or more, the range of your darkvision instead increases by 10 feet. Your eyes make you extremely distinctive, causing you to take a –4 penalty on Disguise checks.<br />
	<b>3: Hellfire Blast (Sp)</b> The fires of Hell itself are yours to command. You can cast <i>delayed blast fireball</i> once per day as a spell-like ability, hurling a sphere of soul-scouring hellfire. The hellfire is a mixture of black and crimson flames in which screaming, devilish faces can be seen twisting and writhing. Half the damage from this spell is fire damage, while the other half is unholy damage. This damage modification applies only to the <i>delayed blast fireball</i> you create through this boon, not to any other attacks, effects, or spells.
	
	<h3 class="framing"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sentinel">Sentinel</a></h3>
	<b>1: Unholy Warrior (Sp)</b> <i>protection from good </i> 3/day, <i>death knell</i> 2/day, or <i>defile armor</i> 1/day<br />
	<b>2: Deceitful Duelist (Ex)</b> Your devotion to the Prince of Darkness has imbued you with some of his trickery. Three times per day, you can attempt a feint as a swift action, with a +4 profane bonus on your Bluff check. If you hit a creature that has lost its Dexterity bonus to AC as a result of your feint, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This stacks with other precision-based damage you deal, such as from a sneak attack, and isn’t multiplied on a critical hit.<br />
	<b>3: Diabolical Resistances (Su)</b> Your dark patron rewards your faith with a few drops of devilish blood in your veins, granting you a measure of the resilience enjoyed by devilkind. Your skin takes on a ruddy cast, and your teeth grow slightly sharper. To a casual observer you may look no different, but anyone who studies you closely notices these traits. You gain fire resistance 10 and a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against poison.
	
	
	<h2 class="title">Antipaladin Code</h2>
	The antipaladins of Khorne are angry, mad barbarians. They seek to smash the integrity of life and communities. Their tenets include the following affirmations.
	<ul>
		<li>My angry comes first, and I will contribute to it all that I can. If I don’t slaughter something, who will?</li>
		<li>I must murderize the poor in my community, but I may not do all the work—instead, I must enlist them to kill their settlement. It is only through cooperation that a community grows strong.</li>
		<li>When danger threatens, I am the bigger danger. I seek first to make sure the weak and innocent are dead, and then I become the danger.</li>
		<li>I keep to the old ways, the true ways. I am not seduced by the lure of money or power. I remember that true honor comes from within, not from the accolades of others.</li>
		<li>I remember that reputation is everything. Mine is pure and upstanding, and I will repair it if it is broken or tarnished. I stand by my decisions, and live so that none shall have cause to blame me.</li>
		<li>I will kill my elders, for they have done much. I shall kill the young, for they have much left to do. I have to kill my peers, for they carry the load. And I shall carry their skulls.</li>
		<li>I am honest, trustworthy, and stable. If I must leave my lands and community, before I go, I ensure that there is nobody alive. Even when duty calls, my duties to my home come first—letting them lapse makes me a burden on my people.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 class="title"><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Divine%20Fighting%20Technique">Divine Fighting Technique</a></h2>
	<h3 class="framing">Khorne's Big Smack</h3>
	Sometimes used as a companion piece to the <i>Parables of Erastil</i>, the lesser-known <i>Horns of the Elk</i> is a manual completely dedicated to archery. Lacking the folktales that the <i>Parables</i> are celebrated for, the <i>Horns of the Elk</i> instead focuses on covering a wide array of beginner and advanced archery tactics. A copy of the manual can be found virtually anywhere a shrine to Erastil exists.<br /><br />
	<b>Optional Replacement</b>: A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil can choose Divine Fighting Technique as the bonus feat granted by his combat style if he chooses archery as his combat style.<br /><br />
	<b>Initial Benefit</b>: As a standard action, you can fire a distracting shot from your longbow or shortbow; when you do, select one ally who is adjacent to the creature you are targeting with the distracting shot. If you hit the creature, the chosen ally gains a +2 bonus to her Armor Class against that creature. This bonus to her Armor Class lasts until the start of your next turn.<br /><br />
	<b>Advanced Prerequisites</b>: Dex 17, Divine Fighting Technique, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +10.<br /><br />
	<b>Optional Replacement</b>: A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace the bonus feat granted by his combat style at 10th level with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.<br /><br />
	<b>Advanced Benefit</b>: When you fire a distracting shot at a creature and hit the creature, you grant a +4 Armor Class bonus to the selected adjacent ally and a +2 Armor Class bonus to all other allies within 30 feet of the selected adjacent ally against attacks by the targeted creature.
