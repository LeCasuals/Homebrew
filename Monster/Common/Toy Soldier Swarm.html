	<h3 class="framing">Special Abilities</h3>
	<b>Reactive Tactics (Ex)</b> A toy soldier swarm’s tactics adjust and change during battle depending upon how badly it was damaged in the previous round.<br />
	• <i>Start of Combat</i>: At the start of any combat, a toy soldier swarm’s statistics are unmodified; a toy soldier reverts to this mode after 1 minute of not engaging in combat.<br />
	• <i>Offensive Tactics</i>: At the start of any round after which the toy soldier swarm took fewer than 15 points of damage during the previous round, the soldiers become more violent at the expense of defense. The swarm takes a –2 penalty to its AC but inflicts 4d6 damage with its swarm attack and the save DC of its distraction ability increases to DC 19.<br />
	• <i>Defensive Tactics</i>: At the start of any round after which the toy soldier swarm took more than 15 points of damage during the previous round, the soldiers adopt defensive tactics. The swarm’s damage is reduced to 2d6 and the save DC for distraction to DC 15, but it gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws.<br />
	• <i>Desperate Tactics</i>: At the start of any round during which a toy soldier swarm has fewer than 10 hp, it adopts defensive tactics and deals only 1d6 damage with its swarm and does not distract, but it does gain fast healing 20. A toy soldier swarm cannot perform desperate tactics two rounds in a row.<br />
	<b>Volley (Ex)</b> Up to three times a day, if a toy soldier swarm cannot reach a foe within sight to inflict swarm damage, it can fire a volley of tiny missiles (typically arrows or spears) to a range of 20 feet. All creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst take 6d6 points of piercing damage from the volley (DC 21 Reflex half).
	
	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	The first of these swarms of tiny soldiers were invented by a toymaker who loved peace and hoped to replace all real-life bloody conflicts with harmless games. Unfortunately, she tried so hard to make her war game a perfect simulation that she ended up creating a deadly army, one that eventually took her life.<br />
	Toy soldiers come in many variations, although these are purely cosmetic—a toy soldier swarm of tiny ogres functions the same as toy soldier swarm of tiny humans or tiny halflings. Each toy’s relative size is always the same, regardless of the size of the creature it emulates. Toy soldiers are usually built to resemble humanoid creatures, but creative toymakers might craft them in more unusual shapes.<br />
	Deadly as they are, toy soldiers have not seen widespread use. Other guardians often prove better, and toy soldiers are expensive and hard to make. As a result, these tiny automatons are rarely seen except inside the homes of unhinged toymakers or eccentric collectors who like the idea of warding off potential thieves with an army of toy swordsmen.<br />
	
	<h1 class="title">Construction</h1>
	A toy soldier swarm consists of several hundred diminutive constructs, each of which is painstakingly crafted with several points of articulation. The animating force within a toy soldier swarm lies not in each individual component, but is shared among them all, and consists of magical energies siphoned from the First World. The soldiers themselves collectively cost 2,000 gp to craft.<br />
