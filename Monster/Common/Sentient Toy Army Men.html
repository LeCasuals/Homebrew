	<h3 class="framing">Special Abilities</h3>
	<b>Volley (Ex)</b> Up to three times a day, if a sentient toy army men cannot reach a foe within sight to inflict swarm damage, it can fire a volley of tiny projectiles to a range of 20 feet. All creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst take 3d6 points of piercing damage from the volley (DC 14 Reflex half).<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Slow (Su)</b> The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the needle is removed.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Soul Swap (Su)</b> The top targets a creature you can see within 15 feet of it that is hit by its Silver Needle. Unless the taget is protected by a protection spell, it has its consciousness swapped with the toy. The toy gains control of the target's body, and the target is unconscious for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the toy's body. While controlling the target's body, the toy retains its mental scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features or proficencies.<br/>
	If the toy's body is destroyed, both the toy and the target die. A protection spell cast on the controlled body drives the toy out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the toy's Silver Needle.<br/>
