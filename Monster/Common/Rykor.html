	<b>Headless (Ex)</b> Though otherwise humanoid, a rykor has no head, merely a hole where its neck should be. This makes the rykor immune to effects that would cause blindness or deafness, as well as other effects that requires the rykor to see or hear the creature causing the effect (such as gaze attacks).<br />
	
	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	No one knows exactly when in the timeworn prehistory of Barsoom the strange creatures known as kaldanes evolved, but as far as anyone in the Heliumetic Empire knows, the spider-legged creatures are found only in the region of the valley of Bantoom just south of the equator in the Red Planet's eastern hemisphere. The kaldanes themselves claim to be at the utmost pinnacle of Barsoomian evolution, their biology consisting of little more than large brains with rudimentary vital organs, them ost sought-after role in their culture being to think undisturbed with their vast intellects in their underground burrows. According to the ancient legends of the kaldanes, their species once had humanoid torso equipped with arms and legs, but after the kaldanes spent millennia deep in their burrows in an advanced state of thinking, their lower bodies and limbs became vestigial and eventually disappeared altogether. Similiarly, the kaldanes pridefully attribute their psychic abilities to untold eons of concentrated cogitation. As kaldanes are a relatively recent discovery to the people of Helium, the empire's scientists have yet to rule on the veracity of these kaldane legends.<br />
	When not riding a rykor mount, a kaldane walks about on six arachnid-like legs and can manipulate objects and tear at its prey with a pair of keen chelae. The creature's head is round, often slightly oblate, and usually only slightly larger than a human's. It peers at the world with two lidless eyes, and its prey often mistakenly believes it has been hypnotized by the kaldane's intense gaze rather than its psychic mind control. Most kaldanes are incapable of producing offspring. Only the kaldane king can lay eggs, and a king hatches from only one out of a thousand eggs. Kaldanes have no lungs and don't need to breathe.<br />
	A rykor is a headless body with a gaping orifice at the heck into which a kaldane inserts its nerve ganglia to interfact with its mount's nervous system and control it. Rykors are mindless creatures bred by kaldanes to provide manual labor and to serve as both food and mounts. They are the same size as the torsos of the red Martians they resemble, and their red skin is only a shade lighter.
