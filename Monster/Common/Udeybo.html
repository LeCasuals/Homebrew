	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	Udeybo are enormous, intelligent beasts that reside in the jungle of Ugoma. They are typically docile and content with avoiding other creatures. Their intelligence enables them to avoid dangers whenever possible, though they are more than willing to retaliate if provoked. Udeybo's thick horns can pierce the hide of most creatures, making them dangerous foes when agitated. Additionally, their powerful bodies are able to knock over smaller creatures to be trampled underfoot, whereupon their tough hooves and massive frame crush their victims. Such tramplings usually occur accidentally as an udeybo is attempting to flee, rather than being intentional attacks. Udeybo are timid and hard to track. They use their great height to spot would-be predators and threats from a distance and take advantage of the early warnings to flee. Udeybo know Ugoma better than most creatures and use this knowledge to better hide among the jungle.<br/>
	Some believe udeybo to be benelovent creatures, helping those lost in the jungle to find their way home or serving as a good omen from Powisienne, the god of nature. Tales are told of udeybo that manifest to lead the lost to safety, appearing even in jungles other than Ugoma. These udeybo vanish once the lost are safe, but they leave behind blooming flowers or precious fruit as a symbol of Powisienne's blessing. Due to udeybo's timid nature and connection to the Shepherd God, some consider them sacred creatures. These people believe that they act as agents of Powisienne himself, despite their lack of any divine power or magical abilities. Others instead view udeybo as they would any other beast: wild creatures that can pose a great danger. A common saying among both of these groups is "Do not prod an udeybo." This serves as warning both to avoid searching for trouble and to not question good fortune.<br/>
	An udeybo stands about 20 feet tall and can weigh as much as 3,000 pounds.
