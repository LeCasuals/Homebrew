	<h3 class="framing">Special Abilities</h3>
	<b>Auto-Cleave (Ex)</b> When a spinning top attacks in melee, you don’t have to resolve each of these as a separate attack. Instead, when the top attacks with its spin, it rolls its attacks normally and hits every creature in its reach each time an attack roll exceeds that creature’s AC. If any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is applied to one creature of the top’s choosing.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Slow (Su)</b> The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the needle is removed.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Soul Swap (Su)</b> The top targets a creature you can see within 15 feet of it that is hit by its Silver Needle. Unless the taget is protected by a protection spell, it has its consciousness swapped with the toy. The toy gains control of the target's body, and the target is unconscious for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the toy's body. While controlling the target's body, the toy retains its mental scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features or proficencies.<br/>
	If the toy's body is destroyed, both the toy and the target die. A protection spell cast on the controlled body drives the toy out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the toy's Silver Needle.<br/>
	
	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	If you are reading this, you must be Indy or you're Eugene being nosy. Hello, this is a your character's new body. Please replace mental stats of this character with your original character's mental stats. If you're wondering why the toy is so large, take note that its not large, its small.<br/><br/>
	Indy: But Andrew, a toy should be tiny or diminutive .<br/>
	Andrew: Ah, but I can have this conversation depicted where you're a soyjak thus you lose.<br/>
	Indy: I admit defeat.<br />
