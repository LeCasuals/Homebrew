	<h3 class="framing">Special Abilities</h3>
	<b>Fated (Su)</b> A candlewick adds its Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to AC and on Initiative checks.<br />
	<b>Searing Tendrils (Su)</b> A candlewick’s searing tendrils are primary attacks.<br />
	<b>Refraction (Su)</b> Once per day as a standard action, a candlewick can create seven shimmering duplicates of itself which appear anywhere within 60 feet of the candlewick and last a number of rounds equal to the candlewick’s Charisma modifier (typically 7 rounds). These refractions are identical to the original in all respects except that when conjured they have a number of hit points equal to 20% of the true candlewick’s maximum hit points (22 hit points for a typical candlewick). The refractions have all of the true candlewick’s melee attacks and abilities, except they can only make one searing tendril attack each, can’t use spell-like abilities, and can’t use refraction. All refractions take their turn immediately after their creator candlewick’s turn concludes. Refractions take double damage from spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor. If the candlewick is slain, is rendered unconscious, or is ever more than 60 feet from a refraction, the affected refractions instantly vanish.<br />
	<b>Shining Light (Su)</b> A candlewick radiates bright light in a 20-foot radius. It can suppress this aura for 1 round as a move action. This light counters magical darkness effects as if it were a 5th level spell effect.
	
	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	According to one legend, these mischievous little fey are spawned from candles that start theater fires. According to another, candlewicks were created by the Lantern King himself after he played an elaborate joke involving a thousand candles, then laughed so hard that he inadvertently breathed life into them. If you ask a candlewick itself, it would eagerly confirm both these legends and then recite a dozen more.<br />
	
	With their small size and cheerful dispositions, candlewicks appear to be harmless, flighty creatures. This demeanor hides their sharp wit and weird, paradoxical sense of humor. While not necessarily malicious, candlewicks are unpredictable and sometimes even cruel pranksters. They value a good laugh above all, and don’t care who gets harmed in the process.<br />

	Candlewicks are creatures of light. They love sunlight the most and grow depressed in dark places. Most candlewicks have a seething hatred of will-o’-wisps and are quick to take offense if confused for one (which would likely result in the offending creature becoming the target of a particularly cruel prank).<br />

	Candlewicks are very social and avoid being alone. They prefer to travel with small groups of other fey creatures or even mortals, and have been known to tag along with traveling circuses or to pester groups of adventurers, playing pranks on them for their own amusement. More than one adventuring party has perished due to their pranks, but there have also been cases of candlewicks saving the people they were tormenting from peril. After all, it’s tough for a candlewick to prank a dead person
