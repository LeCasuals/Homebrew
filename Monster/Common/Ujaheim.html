	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	The ujaheim are fearsome beasts with terrifying fangs that extend out from their mouths. These beasts are great hunters, catching prey across the deserts with unmatched speed. An ujaheim is capable of a burst of great speed, pouncing on its prey to pin a creature on the ground. Once an ujaheim’s prey is knocked down, it usually has no chance of escaping from the ujaheim’s fangs. Ujaheim use their natural coloration to hide among sands and cliffs which helps them ambush their prey.<br />
	An ujaheim is typically 8 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.<br />
	Ujaheim’s ferocity makes them valuable mounts for the grachukk. Although it is a difficult and usually dangerous task to tame an ujaheim, grachukk are more than willing to risk their lives for the boon of being the master of such a powerful beast. Tame ujaheim seem more than willing to work with their riders, as they enjoy the thrill of the chase when acting as mounts for ujaheim riders. When acting as a mount, an ujaheim tends to encounter more powerful creatures than are usually found in the deserts, allowing the ujaheim to push its natural abilities to the limit. These tamed ujaheim remain fiercely loyal to their riders, but they are hostile towards anyone else who might attempt to ride them, even their riders’ allies. The bond between an ujaheim and its rider is so strong that the ujaheim is willing to give its life to defend its rider against any foe. In cases where a rider is injured, its ujaheim guards the injured rider and sometimes even attempts to bring the rider to safety. If an ujaheim’s rider passes away, the ujaheim becomes untamable, and any further attempts to ride the ujaheim end in disaster.
