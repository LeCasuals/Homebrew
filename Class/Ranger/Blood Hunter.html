	<b>Source</b> Vampire Hunter D<br />
	The blood hunters of Asunda are expert warriors who serve as the ultimate bounty hunters of the land. Their skills are unrivaled, and their uncanny prowess at tracking and hunting borders on the supernatural.<br /><br />

	<b>Favored Target (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, as a move action, a blood hunter can declare a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table as the target of his hunt. The blood hunter then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against these creatures. A blood hunter can maintain these bonuses against only one creature type at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the blood hunter declares a new favored target or 1 hour passes, whichever comes first.<br /><br />
	At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against this favored target increase by 1.<br /><br />
	At 7th level, a blood hunter can declare a favored target as a move or swift action.<br /><br />
	Favored target is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the favored enemy ranger class feature. Additionally, the favored target ability always grants or uses a minimum of the blood hunter’s full favored target bonus for the purposes of effects that use the value of the ranger’s favored enemy bonus. For example, a blood hunter grants his full favored target bonus to his companion when using the hunter’s bond class feature.<br /><br />
	This replaces favored enemy, the combat style feat gained at 2nd level, and woodland stride.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Hunting Ground (Ex)</b>: A blood hunter selects only one type of terrain as his favored terrain. The bonuses he gains while in this terrain increase by 2 at 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter.<br /><br />
	Starting at 4th level, a blood hunter can declare a new terrain as his favored terrain. This requires studying the terrain in a process that requires 1 hour of time within the terrain. Once the new terrain is declared as his favored terrain, it remains his favored terrain until the blood hunter declares a new favored terrain.<br />
	At 7th level, a blood hunter gains <u><a href="../../General/Blessed%20Hunter">Blessed Hunter</a></u> as a bonus feat. The territory he chooses with the Blessed Hunter feat must always be a location that matches his favored terrain. When the blood hunter chooses a new favored terrain, he can also choose a new territory with the Blessed Hunter feat.<br />
	At 10th level, he gains <u><a href="../../General/Blessed%20Hunters%20Stride">Blessed Hunter’s Stride</a></u> as a bonus feat.<br />
	At 13th level, he gains <u><a href="../../General/Blessed%20Hunters%20Focus">Blessed Hunter’s Focus</a></u> as a bonus feat, except he treats his ranger level as his hunter level for the purposes of that feat.<br /><br />
	This alters favored terrain and replaces spells.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Rapid Quarry (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a blood hunter can denote a target as his quarry as part of declaring his favored target. If he dismisses the effects of his quarry as a free action, he can select a new quarry after 1 hour. If his quarry dies, he can select a new quarry after 10 minutes have passed.<br /><br />
	At 19th level, if his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 1 minute has passed.<br /><br />
	This alters quarry and improved quarry.<br /><br />
