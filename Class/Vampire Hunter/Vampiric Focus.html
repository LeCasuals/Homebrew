	<h1 class="title">Vampire Focus</h1>
    A vampire hunter knows the sinister power of the undead. Through discipline and precision, he can temporarily turn the unholy powers of the undead against them.<br /><br />
	At 1st level, the vampire hunter must select one common vampiric power to mimic from the vampiric foci listed below. Each vampiric focus grants the vampire hunter a bonus or special ability. Once this decision is made, the vampire hunter cannot change which vampiric focus he knows. At 8th and 16th level, the vampire hunter learns an additional vampiric focus.<br /><br />
	As a swift action, the vampire hunter can activate his vampiric focus. Ending the vampiric focus is a free action. He can use each vampiric focus for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. Once the vampire hunter ends a focus, it cannot be reactivated for 1 minute. The vampire hunter can have only one vampiric focus active at a time. Benefits from different vampiric foci do not stack with one another, including temporary hit points from multiple foci.<br /><br />
	
    <h2 class="title">Vampire Foci</h2>
	
	<b>Vampiric Agility</b>: All of the vampire hunter’s movement speeds are increased by 5 feet. At 8th level, his movement speeds are increased by 10 feet and he gains evasion, as the rogue class feature. At 16th level, the vampire hunter gains improved evasion, as the rogue advanced talent.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Call</b>: The vampire hunter summons base creatures of the night—bats, rats, insects, and the like—to swarm around him. These creatures provide a measure of defense against damage, granting the vampire hunter a number of temporary hit points equal to his level. At 8th level, he also gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. At 16th level, the deflection bonus increases to +4.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Cunning</b>: The vampire hunter gains a bonus on Perception and Stealth checks equal to half his level. At 8th level, he can move at his normal speed while using Stealth with no penalty. At 16th level, the vampire hunter can use Stealth while charging (but not while making any other attack); when charging (and only when charging), he can attempt a Stealth check even if he lacks cover relative to his target.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Heart</b>: The vampire hunter gains energy resistance equal to half his level against cold and electricity. Additionally, the vampire hunter’s heartbeat is undetectable. Any ability that detects or identifies the living, such as the lifesense ability, does not perceive him. At 16th level, once per day when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points while this focus is activated, the vampire hunter immediately turns gaseous (as the spell gaseous form) for up to a number of rounds equal to half his level and he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half his level. The vampire hunter can leave gaseous form at any time without losing these temporary hit points. This effect ends after these rounds have elapsed, after the vampire hunter loses the temporary hit points, or once this focus is no longer active, at which point the vampire hunter immediately becomes corporeal and loses these temporary hit points. If he has not received healing in the interim, this returns the vampire hunter to the number of hit points he had after the attack or effect that triggered this ability.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Might</b>: The vampire hunter gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and his weapons are always treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Momentum</b>: The vampire hunter is treated as being under the effects of the spell feather fall. At 8th level, he is also affected as if by the spell spider climb and can move normally through difficult terrain. At 16th level, he is treated as being under the effects of the spell freedom of movement, and can use up to two consecutive move actions in the same turn to cross areas of open air or calm water (or similar substances) as if they were solid ground, though the vampire hunter must begin and end this movement on solid ground. This allows the vampire hunter to cross water, open air, lava (though he takes fire damage as normal if not immune), and the like without falling or sinking.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Presence</b>: The vampire hunter gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4, and he can cast charm person as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his adjusted Charisma modifier. At 16th level, the enhancement bonus to Charisma increases to +6, and the vampire hunter can cast dominate person as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his adjusted Charisma modifier. The vampire hunter treats his level as his caster level when using the spell-like abilities this ability grants.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Resilience</b>: The vampire hunter gains protection against energy drain. Each time this vampiric focus is activated, the first two times he would gain a negative level, he instead does not. At 8th level, the first four times he would gain a negative level while this focus is activated, he does not. At 16th level, the first six times he would gain a negative level while this focus is activated, he does not gain any negative levels.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Resolve</b>: The vampire hunter gains a +2 bonus on Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If he has already been affected by a mind-affecting effect when he activates this focus, he can immediately reroll his saving throw against that effect with a bonus equal to half his vampire hunter level. At 16th level, he is immune to mindaffecting effects.<hr />
	<b>Vampiric Sight</b>: The vampire hunter gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet (if he already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet). At 8th level, the range of the vampire hunter’s darkvision increases by 30 feet. At 16th level, the vampire hunter also gains blindsense to a range of 30 feet.<hr />
