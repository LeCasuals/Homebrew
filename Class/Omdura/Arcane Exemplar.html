	<b>Source</b> Niobe<br />
	In some cases, especially with regards to gods of magic, an omdura learns to manipulate magical forces and arcane secrets to aid her god. These omduras do not receive spells from their god, but instead gain arcane insight from their god that allows them to manipulate arcane energies.<br /><br />

	<b>Arcane Insight</b>: An arcane exemplar casts arcane spells drawn from the <u><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Class=Magus">magus spell list</a></u>, as a magus of her level. She uses her Charisma score and modifier in place of her Intelligence score and modifier for the purposes of learning spells, casting spells, determining spell DCs and bonus spells, and any other effects related to spellcasting.<br /><br />
	An arcane exemplar must study a spellbook each day to prepare her spells, as a magus. She begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level magus spells plus three 1st-level magus spells of her choice. The arcane exemplar also selects a number of additional 1st-level magus spells equal to her Charisma modifier to add to her spellbook. At each new arcane exemplar level, she adds two new magus spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcane exemplar level) to her spellbook. At any time, an arcane exemplar can also add spells found in other spellbooks to her own.<br /><br />
	This alters spells and orisons.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Spellstrike (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, an arcane exemplar gains the magusâ€™s spellstrike class feature.<br /><br />
	This replaces divine touch.<br /><br />

	<b>Divine Arcana (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an arcane exemplar gains one <u><a href="https://aonprd.com/MagusArcana.aspx">magus arcana</a></u>. She gains an additional magus arcana at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. The arcane exemplar treats her omdura level as her magus level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites of a magus arcana.<br /><br />
	If a magus arcana requires the arcane exemplar to expend points from the magus arcane pool, the arcane exemplar can expend either minutes of her invocation ability or prepared spells in place of the required points. If she expends minutes of her invocation ability, each minute expended in this way counts as 1 point expended from the magus arcane pool. If she expends prepared spells, the number of points expended from the magus arcane pool is equal to the level of the expended prepared spell.<br /><br />
	This replaces divine infusion.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Spell Recall (Su)</b>: At 5th level, an arcane exemplar can recall a spell she has already cast. Once per day as a swift action, she can recall any single magus spell that she has already prepared and cast that day. The spell she recalls must be at least 1 level below the highest spell level the arcane exemplar can cast. At 17th level, she can recall any spell, regardless of its level. She can use this ability one additional time per day at nth level and at 17th level. In addition, she can expend minutes of her invocation ability to recall a spell as a swift action. She must expend a number of minutes equal to the level of spell she is attempting to recall when recalling a spell in this way.<br /><br />
	This replaces divine weapon.<br /><br />
