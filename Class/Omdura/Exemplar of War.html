	<b>Source</b> Niobe<br />
	Some omduras are chosen by their gods to lead their followers into combat, waging war against the enemies of the faith. These warriors are unable to cast spells, but they command exceptional combat prowess that allows them to excel on the battlefield.<br /><br />

	<b>Divine Training (Ex)</b>: An exemplar of war gains a bonus feat at 1st level and every 3 levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats.<br /><br />
	At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an exemplar of war can learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat she has already learned. In effect, the exemplar of war loses the old bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. An exemplar of war can swap out only one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus feat for the level.<br /><br />
	This replaces spells.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Chosen Warrior (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an exemplar of war gains the Chosen One feat as a bonus feat. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the exemplar of war gains an additional bonus feat. These feats must be selected from the following list: Blessed by a God or Dragon, Chosen One’s Might, or Chosen One’s Resilience. At 9th level, the following feats are added to the list: Chosen One’s Determination and Chosen One’s Wrath. An exemplar of war can ignore any level prerequisites for these bonus feats, but she must meet all other prerequisites. If the exemplar of war selects Blessed by a God or Dragon as a bonus feat, she can plea for assistance from her god once per day instead of once per week.<br /><br />
	This replaces divine infusion.<br /><br />
