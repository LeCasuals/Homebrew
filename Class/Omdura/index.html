	<h1 class="title">Omdura</h1>
	<b>Source</b> Niobe<br />
	Acting as divine warriors, omduras embody the tenets of their gods and serve as divine vessels. In the world of Asunda, omdura means “leader of souls” omdaris the masculine form and omdurais the feminine form. As Niobe is a woman, the feminine form of the class is used throughout this section. These mortals are granted greater purpose and are tasked with both spreading their god’s faith and defeating the faith’s enemies. Omduras are able to grant the same divine power they hold within themselves to others around them. This allows omduras to both defend others from enemies of their faith and inspire others to follow in their footsteps. Gods of all kinds select omduras to enact their will, though how this will is interpreted varies from omdura to omdura.<br /><br />
	<b>Role</b>: Omduras’ divine abilities allow them to support their allies with spellcasting and the divine power of their gods. When fighting on their own, they call forth their god’s power to help them defeat their enemies, channeling a god’s divine force into mighty weapons.<br />
	As their powers are influenced by their faith, all omduras must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of omduras revere a specific deity (or multiple deities), a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion-such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge-free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)<br /><br />
	<b>Alignment</b>: An omdura’s alignment must be within one step of her deity’s.<br />
	<b>Hit Die</b>: d8.<br />
	<b>Starting Wealth</b>: 4d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).<br /><br />
	
	<h2 class="title">Class Skills</h2>
	The omdura’s class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).<br /><br />
	<b>Skill Points at each Level</b>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><br />

	<b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Omduras are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Omduras are also proficient with the favored weapon of their deity.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Aura  (Ex)</b>: An omdura of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a powerful aura corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see the <i>detect evil</i> spell for details).<br /><br />

	<b>Spells</b>:An omdura casts divine spells drawn from the <u><a href="../../Spell/Omdura">omdura spell list.</a></u> The omdura can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an omdura must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The difficulty class for a saving throw against an omdura’s spell is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the omdura’s Charisma modifier.<br /><br />
	Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells.<br /><br />
	Like other spellcasters, an omdura can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on the table above. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score.<br /><br />
	Unlike for clerics, an omdura’s selection of spells is extremely limited. An omdura begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new omdura level, she learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2 above. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an omdura knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2 above are fixed.<br /><br />
	In addition to the spells gained as she gains levels, each omdura also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with “cure” in the name; inflict spells include all spells with “inflict” in the name). These spells are added as soon as the omdura is capable of casting them. A good omdura (or a neutral omdura of a good deity) must select cure spells. An evil omdura (or a neutral omdura of an evil deity) must select inflict spells. An omdura who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can select either cure spells or inflict spells. This choice is made when the omdura gains her 1st level and cannot be changed.<br /><br />
	At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an omdura can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the omdura loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An omdura can swap only a single spell at any given level, and she must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells.<br /><br />
	Unlike a cleric, an omdura need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Orisons</b>: Omduras learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots and can be cast again. Omduras do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</b>: An omdura can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Detect Alignment (Sp)</b>: At will, an omdura can cast detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law. She can use only one of these at any given time.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Invocation (Su)</b>:  An omdura can call forth the power of her deity to improve her allies’ abilities as a standard action.<br /><br />
	When the omdura calls upon this power, she must select one type of invocation from those listed below to grant the benefits to her allies within 30 feet. If the omdura is evil, she grants profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral omduras must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A called invocation cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the omdura is killed, paralyzed, stunned, or knocked unconscious.<br /><br />
	The omdura can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The omdura can change her chosen invocation to another type as a swift action, but doing so expends a 1-minute increment of her invocations.<br /><br />
	At 7th level, an omdura can call an invocation as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, an omdura can call an invocation as a swift action.<br /><br />
	All available omdura invocations can be found <b><a href="Invocation">here.</a></b><br /><br />
	
	<b>Divine Touch (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, an omdura can deliver divine energy by touch. She can deliver either positive energy or negative energy. A good omdura (or a neutral omdura of a good deity) must select positive energy. An evil omdura (or a neutral omdura of an evil deity) must select negative energy. An omdura who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can select either positive or negative energy. This choice is made when the omdura gains this ability and cannot be changed.<br /><br />
	Each day the omdura can use this ability a number of times equal to half her omdura level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, an omdura can use divine energy to restore to a target 1d6 hit points for every 2 omdura levels she has. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the omdura targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. An omdura who delivers negative energy with her touch can instead deal 1d6 points of damage to a living creature for every 2 omdura levels she has. Alternatively, an omdura can use this divine energy to affect undead creatures, dealing damage when delivering positive energy or restoring hit points when delivering negative energy.<br /><br />
	An omdura needs only one freehand to use this ability. Using divine touch to harm a creature requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Creatures do not receive a saving throw against the damage from divine touch. Divine touch is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an omdura two additional uses of the divine touch class feature.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Divine Infusion (Su)</b>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, an omdura can select one divine infusion. Each infusion adds an effect to the omdura’s divine touch ability. The types of infusions available to the omdura are determined by the type of energy the omdura delivers with her divine touch. An omdura who delivers positive energy adds a mercy to her divine touch, treating her omdura level as her paladin level and her divine touch as the paladin’s lay on hands ability. An omdura who delivers negative energy adds a cruelty to her divine touch, treating her omdura level as her antipaladin level and her divine touch as the antipaladin’s touch of corruption ability. At 6th, 9th, and 12th level, she adds infusions to the list of those she can select as though she were a paladin or antipaladin (depending on her divine touch ability) of her omdura level. Divine infusion functions as either the cruelty or mercy class ability, depending on the omdura’s divine touch energy, for the purposes of feats, spells, or effects that work with those class features.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Divine Might (Su)</b>: At 4th level, an omdura can call on the powers of her god once per day to aid in her struggle against her enemies. As a swift action, the omdura chooses one target within sight to be the focus of her divine might. If the target is opposed to the omdura’s alignment on either the law/chaos or the good/evil axis, the omdura adds half her Charisma bonus (minimum +o) to her attack rolls and adds half her omdura level to damage rolls against the target of her divine might. A neutral omdura can choose any target to be the target of her divine might, but she adds only one­ third her Charisma bonus and omdura level.<br /><br />
	In addition, while divine might is in effect, the omdura gains a deflection bonus equal to half her Charisma modifier (one-third for a neutral omdura) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the divine might. If a non­ neutral omdura targets a creature that is not opposed to her alignment, the use of this ability is wasted with no effect.<br /><br />
	The divine might effect remains until the target of divine might is dead or the next time the omdura rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 9th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the omdura can use divine might one additional time per day to a maximum of four times per day at 19th level.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Divine Weapon (Su)</b>: At 5th level, an omdura forms a divine bond with her god. This bond allows the omdura to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a divine spirit. This aid lasts for 1 minute per omdura level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities: brilliant energy, defending, flaming, flaming burst, keen, or speed.<br /><br />
	A lawful omdura can also choose from axiomatic and merciful. A chaotic omdura can also choose from anarchic and vicious. A good omdura can also choose from disruption and holy.<br /><br />
	An evil omdura can also choose from unholy and wounding. A neutral omdura can also add vorpal. Adding a special ability consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses are in addition to any special abilities the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magic, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The divine spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the omdura, but it resumes granting bonuses if the weapon is returned to the omdura. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon.<br /><br />
	An omdura can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.<br /><br />
	If a weapon bonded with a divine spirit is destroyed, the omdura loses the use of this ability for 30 days or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the omdura takes a-1 penalty on weapon attack and damage rolls.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Commune (Su)</b>: At 7th level, the omdura can cast commune once per day as a spell-like ability. She can cast this a second time per day at 15th level.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Improved Invocation (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, when using her invocation class ability, the omdura chooses two invocations to grant her allies. In addition, the omdura also benefits from any one invocation she calls, but she receives only half the invocation’s granted bonus.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Greater Divine Might (Ex)</b>: At 18th level, the omdura uses her full Charisma bonus and full omdura level when using her divine might ability. A neutral omdura uses her full Charisma bonus and her omdura level – 3 when using her divine might ability.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Greater Invocation (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, each day when the omdura regains her spell slots, she chooses one invocation to be active on herself and her allies for the entire day. The omdura receives the full bonus granted by this invocation. This invocation is in addition to her uses of the invocation and improved invocation class abilities.<br /><br />
	
	<h2 class="title">Ex-Omduras</h2>
	An omdura who grossly violates the code of conduct required by her god loses all spells and class features, except for her armor, shield, and weapon proficiencies and bonus feats. She cannot thereafter gain levels as an omdura of that god until she atones for her deeds (see the atonement spell).<br /><br />
	
	<h2 class="title">Alternate Capstones</h2>
	When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can’t select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.<br />

	At 20th level, the character’s repertoire of spells deepens dramatically. She gains an additional spell known for each spell level she can cast. A character of any class with spells known can select this capstone.<br />

	At 20th level, the character shows that a true warrior always has one more surprise the enemy hasn’t seen. The character gains four <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Combat">combat feats</a>. This capstone is available to characters of any class that gains at least four bonus combat feats.<br />

	At 20th level, the character’s endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability.<br />

	At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero—she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages’ guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability.<br />

	At 20th level, the character’s blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has—preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability.<br />
	
	<h3 class="framing">Won’t Stay Dead (Ex)</h3>

	At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM’s discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character’s survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability.<br /><br />
