		"Summary":"Through deep meditative practices and by injecting a concoction of hallucinogens and deadly poisons, some spiritualists discover a way to unmoor their own souls from the confines of their bodies. These spiritualistsâ€™ phantoms are representations of themselves, manifestations of the one foot they already have in the grave. In times of extreme need, though, such a spiritualist may take the next step, freeing her soul almost entirely from the fragility of flesh and bone, invigorating a phantom to lash out with volleys of ectoplasmic force.",
