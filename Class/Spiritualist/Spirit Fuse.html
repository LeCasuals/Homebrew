	<b>Source</b> Vampire Hunter D<br />
	Through deep meditative practices and by injecting a concoction of hallucinogens and deadly poisons, some spiritualists discover a way to unmoor their own souls from the confines of their bodies. These spiritualists’ phantoms are representations of themselves, manifestations of the one foot they already have in the grave. In times of extreme need, though, such a spiritualist may take the next step, freeing her soul almost entirely from the fragility of flesh and bone, invigorating a phantom to lash out with volleys of ectoplasmic force.<br /><br />

	<b>Unbound Spirit (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a spirit fuse can fuel the link between herself and her phantom with her own spirit, lengthening the distance by which they can be separated. When a phantom moves beyond the ranges described in the etheric tether ability, the spirit fuse can sacrifice 1 hit point to keep the phantom stable for 1 round without any special concentration or action. The phantom can operate at any distance from the spirit fuse, so long as she spends 1 hit point each round to maintain their connection. If the spirit fuse chooses not to spend 1 hit point, the effects of etheric tether apply as normal.<br /><br />
	At 12th level, whenever the spirit fuse’s phantom is more than 50 feet away from her but is within 30 feet of one or more allies, those allies each receive a +2 shield bonus to their Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +4 on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. This bonus doesn’t apply if the phantom is unconscious.<br /><br />
	This ability replaces bonded manifestation and greater spiritual interference.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Spirit Burst (Su)</b>: When a spirit fuse reaches 5th level, her phantom can draw upon the spirit fuse’s essence to release wild volleys of ectoplasmic force. As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the phantom can unleash a burst of spiritual energy that affects all creatures within 10 feet of it. Creatures in the area take damage as if the phantom had hit them with a slam attack (roll once for damage regardless of how many creatures are affected). Targets that succeed at a Will saving throw take half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice + the phantom’s Charisma modifier).<br /><br />
	Using this attack causes the spirit fuse to take an unavoidable amount of damage equal to the phantom’s level and dazes her for 1 round. This damage and the dazed effect is not reduced by any damage reduction or other mitigating effects. This ability is a force effect.<br /><br />
	The spirit fuse can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her phantom’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />
	This ability replaces detect undead.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Spirit Ray (Su)</b>: When a spirit fuse reaches 17th level, her phantom can channel the spirit fuse’s essence into a soulshattering blast of spirit energy. As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the phantom can project a 50-foot line of vibrant energy. All creatures in the line take an amount of damage equal to the phantom’s Charisma modifier plus 1d6 points per spirit fuse level.<br /><br />
	Spirits unmoored from physical bodies—incorporeal undead, other phantoms, and the like—take half again as much damage. Targets that succeed at a Will saving throw take half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom’s Hit Dice + the phantom’s Charisma modifier). However, using this attack causes the spirit fuse to take an amount of unavoidable damage equal to the phantom’s level and dazes her for a number of rounds equal to the number of creatures damaged. This damage and the dazed effect is not reduced by any damage reduction or other mitigating effects. This ability is a force effect.<br /><br />
	The spirit fuse can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her phantom’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />
	This ability replaces dual bond.<br /><br />
