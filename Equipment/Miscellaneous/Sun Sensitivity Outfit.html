	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	Dhampirs and other races sensitive to glaring light know a unique hell when traveling under the sun’s vicious rays. To protect against the painful light, members of these races often shield themselves with some combination of heavy cloaks, gloves, tinted glasses, screening salves, and—most importantly—wide-brimmed hats. A sun sensitivity outfit prevents creatures with light sensitivity from being dazzled when walking, traveling, or otherwise performing simple acts in areas of bright natural light. Acclimating to the light still requires a moment of adjustment, so even when wearing this outfit, creatures with light sensitivity are dazzled for 1 minute after entering an area of bright sunlight. Violent activity such as combat (or any other act that might jostle the wearer’s hat) also counters the outfit’s effectiveness, causing the wearer to be subject to light sensitivity as normal. A sun sensitivity outfit offers no protection against magical light, such as the spell daylight.
