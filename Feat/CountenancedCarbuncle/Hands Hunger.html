	<h2><h1 class="title">Hand's Hunger (Countenanced Carbuncle)</h1></h2>
	<b>Source </b>Vampire Hunter D<br />
	Your countenanced carbuncle has strange hungers, and can draw that which it desires near.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Prerequisite: </b><u><a href="Countenanced Carbuncle">Countenanced Carbuncle*</a></u>.<br /><br />
	
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>When the hand occupied by your countenanced carbuncle is empty, the parasite can create a vortex that affects one creature or object within 15 feet, potentially drawing it closer to you (ultimately into the countenanced carbuncle’s grip or mouth). This ability is a full-round action and can be employed a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier. To affect a creature, roll a d20 and add your combat maneuver bonus. If the result exceeds the creature’s CMD, it is dragged 5 feet closer to you. The creature is dragged an additional 5 feet closer for every 5 points by which your result exceeds its CMD. Creatures cannot be dragged into your space, but if your combat maneuver check would result in them being pulled closer to you than possible (if, for example, they were 10 feet away and this effect pulls them 15 feet toward you), your countenanced carbuncle can bite them. This does not require an attack roll; the carbuncle automatically deals 1d4 points of damage. The carbuncle can only bite as part of this ability and cannot otherwise attack.<br/>
	Unattended objects can also be pulled immediately to your hand from anywhere within range, so long as the item weighs 10 pounds or less. Small flames—such as those on candles or uncovered lanterns—are extinguished if they are targeted.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Special: </b>If you have the <u><a href="Hands Autonomy">Hand’s Autonomy</a></u> feat, the countenanced carbuncle may use the abilities of the Hand’s Hunger feat even if you are unconscious.
