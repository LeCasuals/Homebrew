	<b>Source </b>Vampire Hunter D<br />
	You’ve made a peaceful and permanent bargain with a parasitic creature known as a countenanced carbuncle. The being now inhabits your body, aiding you as best it can.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>The countenanced carbuncle helps you in numerous ways, but its periodic, uncontrolled antics are distracting; you take a permanent –2 penalty on concentration checks once you gain this feat.<br/>
	Your countenanced carbuncle manifests as a small, unsettling face upon your palm. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls for attacks you make with a one-handed weapon, a light weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural attack using that hand. You also gain a +1 insight bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks. Once per day as a swift action, you can retrieve any stowed object you carry on your person, provided the object weighs no more than 5 pounds.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Special: </b>If the hand that hosts your countenanced carbuncle is severed from your body, you lose access to the benefits of this feat and all other abilities that have this feat as a prerequisite.
