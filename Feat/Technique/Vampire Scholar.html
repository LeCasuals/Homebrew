	<b>Source </b>Vampire Hunter D<br />
	You know the legends of vampire-kind, both those that are tales and those that are histories.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>You gain Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (nobility) as class skills. Additionally, you can use Knowledge (nobility) to recall the lore of all known vampires, their lands, their servants, and similar specific lore surrounding them. In general, the DC to know about specific vampires is equal to 15 + the vampireâ€™s Hit Dice. The GM might rule that some vampires are particularly secretive or that knowledge about them is particularly well known, and may adjustment this DC as she sees fit.
