	<b>Source </b>Vampire Hunter D<br />
	Your holy water washes away falsehoods.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Prerequisites: </b><u><a href="Blessed Waters">Blessed Waters</a></u>*, base attack bonus +9.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>Holy water you create through the use of the Blessed Waters feat can foil shapeshifters and those affected by deceptive magic. Any creature that takes damage from or that is within the splash radius of holy water you both created and threw is compelled to revert to its true form. This affects beings affected by transmutation magic (such as alter self or gaseous form), by deceptive illusions (such as disguise self or invisibility), or by similar effects (at the GM’s discretion). This ability can even affect creatures using supernatural abilities, such as the change shape ability or a vampire’s gaseous form, though you take a –5 penalty on your dispel checks when attempting to dispel such abilities. In general, any ability or spell that changes one creature into another or makes a creature look like something other than itself (or nothing at all) is affected.<br/>
	An affected creature is subject to a <u><a href="https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dispel%20Magic"dispel magic</a></u> spell, targeting only these effects. If the creature is affected by magic that affects multiple creatures, the dispelling effect affects only the magic working upon that creature (not the entire spell). If the creature is not affected by a shape- changing ability or spell, the holy water affects it as normal. Unless your holy water provokes a transformation, this ability grants no insight into whether or not a creature is a shapeshifter.
