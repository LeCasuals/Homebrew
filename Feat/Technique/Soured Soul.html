	<b>Source </b>Vampire Hunter D<br />
	Your loathing of the undead is so great that your very essence is anathema to such creatures.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>Any creature that drains your vitality through the use of an ability like blood drain, energy drain, any ability score drain, or a similar effect must immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your total HD + your Charisma modifier) after its ability affects you. If the creature fails, it is nauseated for a number of rounds equal to half your total Hit Dice (minimum 1).<br/>
	Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells such as magic jar, possession, and other abilities being used to possess your body, such as a ghost or dybbuk’s malevolence supernatural ability. This does not apply to mind-affecting effects—only to abilities wherein a creature tries to enter and control your body.
