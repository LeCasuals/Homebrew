	<b>Source </b>Vampire Hunter D<br />
	Your boldness inspires even your mount to feats of bravery.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Prerequisites: </b>Handle Animal 5 ranks.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>Choose an animal you can ride as a mount and that you have ridden for a total of more than 1 hour at any prior time. While you are riding it, this creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and emotion effects and is unaffected by the effects of creaturesâ€™ unnatural auras. In addition, while you are riding it, the DC to push that animal with the Handle Animal skill does not increase if it is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage. You can change the animal that receives these effects, but only once per week.
