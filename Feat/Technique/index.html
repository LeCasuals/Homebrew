	<b>Description</b><br />
	At their most basic level, vampire hunter technique feats are a mixture of fighting methods, disciplines, and stories passed down by vampire hunters successful enough to share their methods. Some are known battle tactics that fighters the world over have shared. Others meld magic and finesse to grant mortals an edge over the undead. The most dangerous invite the corruption of the undead into the hunter, allowing him to turn vampiresâ€™ powers and tools against them. The strangest rely on mysteries of the old world and possibly even those beyond to confound creatures who think themselves immortal.<br /><br />
	Vampire hunter technique feats can only be accessed by members of the vampire hunter class or those who have the Vampire Hunter Tradition feat (or a similar ability). Unless such a feat specifically says otherwise, other characters cannot choose these feats, even if they meet the prerequisites.<br /><br />
