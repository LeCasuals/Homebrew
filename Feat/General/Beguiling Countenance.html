	You stand out among the crowd, possessing a singular, enticing bearing.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Prerequisites: </b>Cha 13<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>Some exceptional combination of your features and comportment enthralls those around you. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks when engaging with creatures that might find your race attractive (regardless of gender). If you are a dhampir, this means most humanoids, with some additions or exceptions at the GMâ€™s discretion (upon taking this feat, work with the GM to decide 5 to 10 races or types of creatures that find you attractive). Additionally, the first time each day that you use Intimidate against such an individual to force him to act friendly toward you, he does not treat you as unfriendly afterward (though he still does if you use Intimidate against him again during the same day). The effects of this feat do not have to be entirely based off your physical appearance, though you should have a sense of what about you others find remarkable.
