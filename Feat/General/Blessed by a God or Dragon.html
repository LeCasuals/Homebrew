	<b>Source </b>Niobe<br />
	Your god’s favor allows you to call upon that god for divine assistance.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Prerequisites: </b><u><a href="Chosen One">Chosen One</a></u>, character level 7th, must worship a god.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>Once per week, as a ritual that requires 10 minutes to perform, you can plead to your god for assistance. You can also use this ability as a swift action, but your god considers this a great favor and will not respond to your pleas using this feat for 1 month afterward. The assistance from your god allows you to cast one spell from the cleric spell list, treating your character level as your cleric level when determining what spells you can choose from. You must still cast the spell as normal, paying for any material components and providing any divine focus required. You use your Wisdom modifier for the purpose of determining the effects and DC of this spell. If you are already capable of casting cleric spells, you treat your character level as 3 levels higher for the purposes of this feat. At your GM’s discretion, this ability can replicate more powerful abilities.
