	<b>Source </b>Niobe<br />
	You have been selected by your god to further their divine will.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Prerequisite: </b>Character level 5th, must worship a god.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Benefit: </b>You gain a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on damage rolls against creatures that are considered your god’s enemies or that worship a god who’s an enemy of your god. If your god has no obvious enemies, you gain this bonus against creatures whose alignment is diametrically opposed to your god’s (such as lawful evil creatures if you are a worshiper of a chaotic good god.) If you worship multiple gods, such as part of a pantheon, select one god you represent for the purposes of this feat. Once selected, the choice cannot be changed.
