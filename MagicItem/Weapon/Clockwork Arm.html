	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3> 
	This articulated, mechanical arm is made of bronze, brass, and iron, its joints consisting of precisely placed arrangements of gears and rods. Closer inspection reveals a line of clasps that, when undone, cause the arm to open and reveal its hollow interior. A clockwork arm can thus be worn by any Medium humanoid as an arm-length device; putting it on takes 1 minute of work and adjustment. It can also replace a Medium humanoidâ€™s missing arm with a procedure that requires 8 hours of work and success at a DC 25 Craft (clockwork) check. Whether it is worn over an existing arm or as a replacement arm, a clockwork arm takes up the hand and wrist slot of the creature wearing it.<br />
	A clockwork arm grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. A character who wields a one-handed or light weapon with this arm gains a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts. Finally, the hand itself can be used as a +1 gauntlet that inflicts 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
