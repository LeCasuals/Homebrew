	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3> 
	This unusual-looking suit of +2 studded leather armor has been fitted with a set of drums on the back, a frame on the helm that holds a set of panpipes, and adjustable armatures on the side of the torso that hold a lute. These three instruments are fully integrated into the armor and cannot be removed without destroying the one-person orchestra. A character who wears the suit can use it to make Perform (percussion, string, or wind) checks without needing to expend any actions to stow or retrieve the instruments in question. In addition, the three instruments themselves can each be used to generate a specific magical effect once per day each.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Panpipes</b>: Once per day as part of any action used to start a bardic performance, a bard using these panpipes treats the effects of that performance as if they were generated by a bard of five levels higher. This effect lasts as long as the bard maintains that particular performance.</li>
	<li><b>Lute</b>: Once per day as part of any action used to start a bardic performance, a bard can use the lute to gain the effect of a shield spell for the duration of her bardic performance.</li>
	<li><b>Drums</b>: Once per day as a swift action, a bard can cause any sonic or electricity spell she casts of 6th or lower level to become empowered, as if by the Empower Spell feat.</li>
	</ul>
