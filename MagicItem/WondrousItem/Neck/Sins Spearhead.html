	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3> 
	This jade spearhead is intentionally crafted to allow the crafter to watch the user from a distance. It’s typically given to prisoners tasked with acting as soldiers, allowing the bearer to ensure the prisoners remain on task.
	<ul><li>The spearhead can be worn as an amulet in the neck slot. While it’s worn this way, the wearer’s skin hardens, granting the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to natural armor and DR 10/adamantine.</li>
	<li>The spearhead can instead be attached as the spearhead of an existing non-magical spear as a standard action. When used as part of a spear, the spearhead transforms it into a +1 vicious version of the original spear (such as a shortspear, spear, or longspear). The wearer can remove the spearhead as a standard action to resume using the spearhead as an amulet, causing the spear to revert to its original, non-magical form.</li></ul>
	The spearhead also functions as a unique divination device. Each spearhead can be magically linked with another spearhead by touching the two together as a full-round action. This creates a one-way link between the two. Once per day, the holder of the spearhead can cast scrying to observe a linked spearhead. The spearhead can observe only a single linked spearhead in this way, but can be linked with any other spearheads.<br/>
