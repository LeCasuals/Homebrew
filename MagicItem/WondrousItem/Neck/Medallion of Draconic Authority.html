	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3> 
	This golden medallion is approximately hexagonal in shape, with a five-pointed star embellishing each vertex. A circle engraved with the symbol of the Order of the Dragon - a dragon eating its own tail - sits at the center of the medallion. A <i>medallion of draconic authority</i> is a valued treasure for members of the Order of the Dragon, both as an artifact of the order's history and for its magical power. Three times per day as a standard action, the owner of a <i>medallion of draconic authority</i> can present it to a creature of the dragon type, affecting it as per charm monster (Will DC 16 negates). The DC increases by 4 if the medallion is wielded by a member of the Order of the Dragon.<br />
	Unsurprisingly, most dragons - especially the infamously evil chromatic dragons - are incensed by anyone attempting to use this item on them. Those that succeed at their saving throw are likely to immediately attack the wearer, brooking no further talking or attempts at diplomacy. Similarly, once a dragon is no longer under the effect of a <i>medallion of draconic authority</i>, it often tracks down the item's owner and attempts to kill him or her. Either way, most dragons will do anything they can to destroy the medallion, though some amoral dragons have been known to save it for use against members of their own kind. However, this post-charming quest for revenge typically isn't undertaken by less intelligent creatures of the dragon type (such as tatzlwyrms and wyverns, which aren't necessarily capable of understanding the magic they've been subjected to), so in general, a <i>medallion of draconic authority</i> is more safely used against those varieties of dragons.
