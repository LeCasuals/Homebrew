	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	This unique <i>ring of elemental command</i> (fire) is made of ilkor with a ruby inset and was forged by Charan himself. The ring glows red hot as if it had been placed in a flame, but is always cook to the touch. The wearer becomes immune to fire and treats her caster level as 2 higher when casting spells with the fire descriptor. The elemental can resist the charm effect of the ring with a successful DC 21 Will save. Esufey with a fire affinity are treated as if they were fire elementals for the purposes of the ring's abilities, including its charm ability. In addition to its typical powers and spells, the ring grants the following additional abilities.<br /><br />
	• Burning Gaze (twice per day)<br />
	• Fire Breath (twice per day)<br />
	• Fire Shield (once per day)<br />
	• Fireball (once per day)<br />
	• Summon Monster VIII (once per week, elder fire elemental only)<br />
	• Wall of Lava (once per week)
	
	<h3 class="framing">Destruction</h3>
	Destroying <i>Charan's Ring</i> requires the ring to be submerged in the water of the Plane of Water by an elder fire elemental. This cools the ring until it is no longer red hot. Once cooled, Charan must strike the ring to shatter it.
