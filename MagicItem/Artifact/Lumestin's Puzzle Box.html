	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	The sides of this handheld puzzle box are of plain, polished light wood, and the lid is adorned with an intricate pattern of darker wood that changes during each full moon. Although the lid has an apparent seam, it is locked and has no visible keyhole or hinge mechanism. Whenever bright light shines on it, the design on the lid trembles slightly making quiet cracking noises.<br /><br />
	The first time a character with at least one rank with any Craft skill touches the box, they must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become fascinated by the box for 1 round as they unconsciously stare at the box in wonder, lost in thought about their next creation. Thereafter, keeping the box in one's workplace provides a +2 insight bonus on all Craft skill checks.<br /><br />
	The box opens itself once a month during the full moon. It can also be opened by crafting a key of bright light to illuminate the darker wood on the lid. Finally, the box opens at the wim of the Lantern King; he usually lets those holding the box think that some action they took caused the box to open. Regardless of how the box opens, when it does, creatures chosen by the box within 30 feet are transported into the demiplane within, arriving in the mansion's entrance hall (area A1). For the purposes of the adventure, you should have this event occur only when all of the PCs and their companions and familiars are in the area, as once creatures arrive within Lumestin's mansion, exit from the puzzle box is difficult.
	
	<h3 class="framing">Destruction</h3>
	Craft a key made of darkness in the shape of the current pattern on the lid, then place the key on the lid and strike the box with a lightcrafted weapon.
