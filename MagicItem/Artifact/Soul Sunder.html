	<h3 class="framing">Description</h3>
	Also known as Madrag Idelka J'Om or the Axe of Dread, <i>Soul Sunder</i> was a gift crafted for Madraq by her daughter, the mountain goddess Mithiriel. The axe is made from Ardan and sports Eog edges. Madraq has bestowed this axe with a terrible curse, compelling the wielder to collect the souls of thos Madraq deems unworthy to live.<br /><br />
	<i>Soul Sunder</i> is a <i>+5 keen battleaxe</i> with a x4 critical multiplier. When the wielder draws the weapon, each creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. Whether or not they succeed at this save, all creatures within 30 feet of <i>Soul Sunder</i> are shaken while the weapon is visible. The cursed wielder of <i>Soul Sunder</i> can call the axe to himself as a standard action regardless of distance, even across planes. Calling the axe in this way is considered drawing it and can cause creatures to become panicked. In addition, the axe ignores the AC bonus from <i>protection from evil</i> and similiar spells. Finally, a creature slain by <i>Soul Sunder</i> must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or have its soul sent directly to the Dark Road to await Madraq's judgment.<br /><br /> 
	Creature slain by <i>Soul Sunder</i> in this way cannot be brought back to life by any means. Only Madraq can lift the curse upon <i>Soul Sunder</i>'s wielder, but she does so only once she is satisfied. Once the curse has been lifted, Madraq can curse a different creature with <i>Soul Sunder</i>.
	
	<h3 class="framing">Destruction</h3>
	A creature must slay the cursed wielder with <i>Soul Sunder</i>, then travel to the Dark Road and also slay the cursed wielder's soul with <i>Soul Sunder</i>. Slaying the cursed soul obliterates <i>Soul Sunder</i>
