	<h1 class="title">Melnibonéan</h1>
	<b>Source</b> Elric of Melniboné<br />
	MELNIBONEANS ARE cruel and elegant, catlike in their senses of pleasure and sport. They are mostly devoid of sentiment and the softer passions. Freed of all but command by their many slaves, individual whims rule Melnibone, commanded by their emperor.
	Melniboneans are powerful sorcerers, and have ruled the world for 10,000 years. The Young Kingdoms despise them as much as the demons they invoke. Highly intelligent and magically inclined, the Melniboneans' long association with Chaos has tainted their very beings.
	Melnibonean adventurers are extremely rare. Before the fall of Imrryr they are an insular people, almost never venturing off of their unapproachable isle. Adventurers who are of pure Melnibonean stock will find the world a hostile place, its people filled with fear as if in the sight of the Devil. The world hates Melnibone.
	Melniboneans themselves are detached and erudite. Every member of Melnibonean society freely pursues his or her own studies, arts, and other pleasures. <br /><br />
	
	<b>Physical Description</b>: Lithe and beautiful, they get mistaken for elves often.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Society</b>: Made up of sociopathic degenerates, they are highly intelligent, manipulative and sadistic. They aren't exactly nice to each other, though they treat other races worse. They are very few taboos in their culture.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Relations</b>: They look down on all other races, especially shorter lived and less magically inclined ones. They see every else as slaves or worthless. They maintain good relationships with evil deities so they might have a barest semblance of civility to a chaos worshipping entity. The only race they will be cordial with are dragons, of which they have descended from.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Alignment and Religion</b>: Almost all are always Evil. Despite worshipping Chaos Gods, they are actually very fixed in their ways and traditions so they are typically Lawful. And they usually worship Chaos Gods. So CE or CN deities.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Adventurers</b>: Finally, contemplate why your Melnibonean has left the paradise of Imrryr to go adventuring. Is
	he curious about the world? Does she seek glory? Does she despise the decadence into which the Bright Empire has fallen? Is he an outcast? Did she flee fearing vengeance? Does he quest for something? 
	
	A strong motive must exist, for few shake off the blissful drugs of the Dreaming City to enter the cold and crude Young Kingdoms. Before the fall of Imrryr, lone Melniboneans wandering the world are exceedingly rare. They will be feared, distrusted, and considered dangerous or unlucky. <br /><br />

It does not reveal an exact value. <br />
