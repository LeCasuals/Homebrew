	<h1 class="title">Skaven</h1>
	<b>Source</b> Warhammer Fantasy<br />
	Skaven are a clan-based society in which the number 13 holds important significance. Skaven are potrayed as sneaky, conniving, selfish, cowardly and backstabbing. They are also closely linked t plague and disease. The Skaven believe themselves to be superior to all other races, especially those that live above ground.<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Age: </b> With a lifespan of about 20 years, asserting that, were it not for the (often violent) internal competition of their species, they might live well past 50. More powerful embers of Skaven tend to live far longer, even hundreds of years, due to the use of drugs or magic.<br/><br/>
	<b>Alignment and Religion: </b> Chaotic. It should be noted that due to these views and their tendency for back-stabbing, no one (not even the minions of Chaos) ever want to count the Skaven as their allies. Everyone who knows about the Skaven knows that there is only one rule for trusting a Skaven: don't.
	All Skaven pay homage to the Horned Rat, their only deity, whom they worship primarily out of fear of retribution.
