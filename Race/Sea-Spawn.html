	<h1 class="title">Sea-Spawn</h1>
	<b>Source</b> Red Sonja<br />
	The true origin of the sea-spawn of the Hyborian Age is as murky as the darkened depths of the Vilayet Sea from which they emerged centuries ago. Some records suggest that they are magical creations, perhaps even the product of the mighty wizard Kulan Gath - arcane beings evolved from the common creatures of the sea. The oral traditions of the neighboring lands such as Turan and Red Sonja's own Hyrkania speak of sea-spawn encounters going back thousands of years, but the sea-spawn most recently drew their squamous hands across history when they joined the mercenary army of Sonja's arch enemy Dark Annissia under the banner of the wicked kingdom of Zamora. Following the army's defeat, hundreds of sea-spawn found themselves drawn into the Worldscape, where they bolstered the ranks of earlier arrivals. Many of these creatures serve Kulan Gath and the armies of Empress Camilla, but some few have set out on their own. Some of them even fight their evil natures to become heroes in their own right.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Physical Description</b>: Sea-spawn vary widely in form, with no two closely resembling one anohter. Each has features adapted from a specific sea creature - the pincers of a giant crab, the spines of a sea urchin, the head of a hammerhead shark, and so on - but even beyond their unique shapes, sea-spawn come in a limitless variety of colors, from bright red like a lobster to muddy green like a bottom-dwelling fish.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Society</b>: Sea-spawn commonly band together for safety and strength of arms. They are carnivorous to a fault, and its not unusual for fights to break out among them based on one sea-spawn sinking its teeth into another simply because it was hungry. Outside the command of a strong leader (usually of a race other than sea-spawn), their military organization is based more on convenience and mutual survival than strategy or tactics. They make little art of their own, instead adorning themselves in hodge-podge armor and accessories culled from the bodies of their victims.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Relations</b>: Sea-spawn live to server (legends suggest that they may have even originally been created to do so), but that doesn't necessarily mean they're very good at it. They commonly find employment as mercenaries or guards to villainous figures or organizations, and most of them follow orders without questioning their morality or purpose. That said, sea-spawn are prone to laziness and brutality, making them relatively untrustworthy long-term allies. Most generals and leader who employ them as part of their forces treat them as cannon fodder (a term that, in the Worldscape, is sometimes literally true).<br /><br />
	
	<b>Alignment and Religion</b>: Sea-spawn are petty and avaricious, prone to arguments among themselves and eager to engage in violence with enemies and with one another. Most rank-and-file sea-spawn are chaotic evil, though their huge diversity applies to philosophy as well as physiology, and the Worldscape is home to sea-spawn of all nine alignments.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Adventurers</b>: Most sea-spawn serve as mercenary soldiers in the evil armies of the Worldscape, but a few escape from this life to become independent warriors similiar to any inhabitant of the prison plane.<br />
	Sea-spawn favor martial pursuits, with the majority tending towards classes like fighter or ranger. Some dedicate themselves to unspeakable evil sea gods or inscrutable alien Old Ones, finding affinity with their common oceanic heritage and walking the path of the cleric.<br /><br />
	
	<h1 class="title">Sea-Spawn Racial Traits</h1>
	<b>+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Intelligence</b>: Sea-Spawn are strong-willed and resilient, but dim-witted.<br />
	<b>Medium</b>: Sea-spawn are Medium creatures and have no bonuses of penalties due to their size.<br />
	<b>Monstrous Humanoid</b>: Sea-spawn are monstrous humanoids with the sea-spawn subtype.<br />

	<b>Darkvision</b>: Sea-spawn can see in the dark up to 60 feet.<br />
	<b>Amphibious</b>: Sea-spawn are amphibious and can breathe both air and water.<br />
	<b>Bite</b>: Sea-spawn gain a natural bite attack, dealing 1d3 damage. The bite is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the creature is wielding manufactured weapons.<br />
	<b>Languages</b>: Sea-spawn begin play speaking Common. Sea-spawn with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).<br />
	<b>Blessing of the Deep</b>: Sea-spawn additionally select one of the following blessings of the deep to further<br />
	<ul>
	<li><b>Sticky Tongue</b>: The sea-spawn can make melee attacks with its long, sticky tongue. This is a secondary attack. A creature hit by this attack cannot move more than 10 feet away from the attacker and takes a -2 penalty to AC as long as the tongue is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple tongues are attached). The tonhue can be removed by the target or an adjacent ally by making an opposed Strength check against the attacking creature as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage does not reduce the sea-spawn's hit points). The sea-spawn cannot move more than 10 feet away from a creature stuck to its tongue, but it can release its tongue from the target as a free action. The sea-spawn can have only one creature attached to its tongue at a time.</li>
	<li><b>Tentacles</b>: Writhing tentacles emerging from the sea-spawn's face, chest, or shoulders grant it the ability to maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main appendages.</li>
	<li><b>Terrifying Croak</b>: Once per hour as a standard action, the sea-spawn can emit a thunderous croah. Any creature not of its type (monstrous humanoid) must make a successful Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the sea-spawn's character level + its Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A target that successfully saves cannot be targeted by the sea-spawn's terrifying croak for 24 hours. Creatures that are already shaken become frightened fro 1d4 rounds instead. This is a sonic, mind-affecting supernatural effect.</li>
	</ul>
