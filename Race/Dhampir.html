	<b>Source</b> Vampire Hunter D<br />
	<b> Main Race</b> <a href="https://www.aonprd.com/RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dhampir">Archives of Nethys Link</a><br />
	Dhampirs descended from the Vampire King are rare in the extreme. Incredibly beautiful but strikingly grim shades that straddle the line between humanity and vampirekind, sacred ancestry dhampirs are often single-minded loners intent on a specific goal. This ancestry should be considered exceptionally rare, and players and GMs should work together to explain why a character possesses such a remarkable legacy. How the dhampir came into being, his relationship to the Vampire King, and which secrets of the past he does or doesn’t remember should all be considered during character creation.<br />
	<b>Alternate Skill Modifiers</b>: Diplomacy, Knowledge (nobility).<br />
	<b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b>: true strike.<br />
	<b>Alternate Weakness</b>: Sacred ancestry dhampirs take a –1 penalty on saving throws against spells of the illusion school.
