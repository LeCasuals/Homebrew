	<h1 class="title">White Martians</h1>
	<b>Source</b> John Carter of Mars<br />
	White Martians evolved upon Barsoom millions of years ago, emerging from an early tribal culture to eventually propel Mars to social, architectural, and cultural heights unmatched in the last 500 centuries. These early white men, known as the Orovars, were the first of Barsoom's residents to conquer agriculture, to tame and domesticate wild beasts, and to build ships to cross the sea, but today they are mostly creatures of legend, symbols of a vibrant Mars filled with ambition and possibility. Their great empires fell as the oceans of Mars evaporated and its athmosphere grew thin, leaving behind elaborate ruined citires that today rise like cenotaphs jutting from the cliffside of timelost seaports or at the deserted hearts of long-forgotten trade routes.<br />
	Though the Orovars are long dead, degenerate white Martians live on in secret caverns and the dark shadows of Barsoomian cities, and while these "therns" are seldom seen, they control the levers of the cult of Issus, and thus impact the religious lives of nearly everry sentience creature on the planet, from the savage green-skinned Tharks to the most finely attired red Martian noble of Helium or Zodanga. The therns' influence continues - and even thrives - in the Worldscape, where they evangelize in the open and form a central role in the power structure that keeps the denizens of the plant from breaking out into open warfare.<br />
	
	<b>Physical Description</b>: Pictographs carved into the walls of ancient Barsoomian cities depict the Orovars with powerful, handsome features and full heads of auburn or yellow hair. Millenia of evolutionary degeneration have robbed the therns of the ability to grow hair, and thus all are completely bald - though you'd never know by looking at them. Therns consider their hairlessness a stigma, and hide it from each other and from the outside world. From the lowliest servant to the holy hekkador himself, therns adorn themselves with elaborate light-colored wigs, with men and women bearing luxuriously long hair dropping well below the shoulders.<br />
	On the contrary, therns in the Worldscape - often bereft of their finery or unable to replace it (the prison-plane being something other than a hotspot of fashion and wig-making), embrace their true natures, rationalizing it as a gift bestowed by Issus to further differentiate them from the other light-skinned folk of the Worldscape. They adorn themselves in the traditional leather harness and shorts of most Barsoomian near-humans, and proudly display their hairless bodies for all to see.<br />
	Higher-caste therns, often called Holy Therns for their greater initiation in the mysteries of Issue, often wear valuable jewels, capes, and scarlet robes of office.<br />
	Befitting their warrior culture, most therns also carry a longsword, short sword, dagger, and radium pistol.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Society</b>: On Barsoom, white Martians are a society unto themselves, living in hidden mountain complexes in the south pole where the River Iss runs into the Valley Dor. As the religion of Issus is so central to their culture, priests of Issus - known as Holy Therns - enjoy the highest status among the therns. Holy Therns further stratify themselves based on their orders of initiation - or "Circles" - with the devotees of higher circles enjoying greater status such as personal wealth, servitor beasts, or slaves culled from the choicest pilgrims of the lesser Martian races. The supreme ruler of the Holy Therns holds the office of the holy hekkador, and controls the worldwide religion of Issus and sits at the apex of thern society.<br />
	The Worldscape currently lacks a holy hekkador, but rumors of a blonde-haired beauty (evidently unwilling to give up the trappings common to her cult) gathering therns to her side and claiming to be the daughter of a holy hekkador - and thus by rights the hekkador of the Worldscape - continue to persist throughout Shareen and its outskirts.<br />
	White Martian society favors obedience to the doctrine of Issue and to her perfect priesthood. Millenia of subtle control over the "lesser" races - indeed the therns believe that they are themselves gods in the image of Issus - has cultivated a deep sense of arrogance and decadence that makes therns overvalue ostentation and wealth.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Relations</b>: Therns believes that all life on Barsoom is created solely for their benefit, making them take a dim view of the valur of non-therns. White and red Martians exist as literal feeding stock - after they reach the Valley Dor, Barsoon's mindless plant men drain the pilgrims of their blood, leaving the "cleansed" flesh behind to be devoured by the white Martians in holy repast, a gift from Issus herself. As a man may eat the flesh of beasts, they reason, gods may eat the flesh of man. As the gods of Barsoom, the therns are entitled to devour anything they wish. (In the Worldscape, the plant men are rare, so the cult has taken to more prosaic blood-draining rituals before partaking in the flesh of sentient creatures.)<br />
	Two of Barsoom's native races earn a more respectful place in the hearts of the white Martians - the plant men and the planet's massive four-armed white apes. The therns interpret ancient Barsoomian myths of a Tree of Life to presume an evolutionary connection between themselves and these unusually monstrous creatures. They believe that the souls of white Martians who do not live out their alloted lifespan of 1000 years are reborn in the image of a plant man. Those reborn plant men who die before the expiration of that original white Martian lifespace are again reborn in the form of a white ape, granting both creatures significant status and protection among the whites, since they believe that each of these creatures was formerly a thern. Should the apie die before the end of the Martian's 1000 year term, the soul becomes trapped for eternity in the body of a mindless worm - hopeless creatures that even the white Martians cannot bring themselves to honor or respect.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Alignment and Religion</b>: White Martians are cunning and quick to betray allies at the moment they appear to be enemies. They follow a rigid religious system that touches nearly every aspect of their lives, making them unusually trusting of authority right up until the moment of betrayal. Most white Martians are lawful evil, and worship Issue, Goddess of Death and Life Eternal.<br />
	Nearly all Barsoomians share a faith in Issus, dreaming one day to take a pilgrimage down the sacred River Iss to the Valley Dor at the planet's south pole, there to receive a reward of eternal paradise after the end of their natural lives. Far from an eternal paradise, this voyage delivers weak and aged Barsoomians into the hands of the therns, who unleash blood-sucking plantmen and the legendary white apes against them, reveling in the carnage and preparing themselves to dine upon the pilgrim's exsanguinated flesh.<br />
	The therns have secret temples hidden in nearly every city of Barsoom from which they spread the word of Issus and keep tabs on the populace, all the while encouraging more of the planet's inhabitants to take the journey upon the Iss that keeps the therns fed. Decrees written in blood upon strange parchment - apparently from Issus herself - appear as if by magic upon the guarded altar of the high hekkador, communicating the decrees and demands of the death goddess directly to her most dedicated followers.<br />
	The Earthman John Carter exposed the therns and their religion as frauds, turning public sentiment on Barsoom against them, but his was only one of many possible Barsooms in the multiverse. Therns from alternate Barsooms, or from periods before the exposure, have found themselves drawn to the Worldscape for centuries. A prison-plane populated by killers and murderers fits their nihilistic philosophy perfectly, and the therns have thrived as their religion has spread.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Adventurers</b>: The tight caste system and regional seclusion of Barsoom's white Martians provide little opportunity for adventuring in the traditional sense. A small number of white Martians manage to find some measure of freedom by being exiled into the south polar region for religious heresy or captured by black Martian moon pirates on one of their periodic airship raids of thern territory, thereafter setting out for themselves as refugees or explorers, but few last for long. White Martians marooned in the Worldscape face considerably greater prospects, where their pale skin allows them to blend in with similarly complexioned denizens of Golarion of Earth. This relative anonymity allows them freedom from the cult of Issus, but their inherent hairlessness forever marks them as a thern and a traitor to their fanatically faithful cousins who remain in thrall to the Goddess of Death and Life Eternal.<br />
	White Martians tend toward martial classes brawler, swashbuckler, or fighter (especially with the warlord archetype). Some Worldscape therns, having escaped from a cult of a false goddess, eagerly devote themselves to deities with true divine power, resulting in zealous dedication to the path of the cleric (usually to thematically comfortable gods like Pharasma or Urgathoa). These "true" priests pose a significant threat to the powerless therns dedicated to Issue, and rank among the cult's most persecuted and hunted enemies.<br /><br />
