	<h1 class="title">Myyrrhn</h1>
	<b>Source</b> Elric of Melnibon√©<br />
	THE WINGED RACE of Myyrrhn is isolated and proud. They dwell high in their aeries in the Vale of Myyrrhn, and tend their own affairs. Noble, stern, and taciturn, they are also handsome, strong, and lithe. Their race is the oldest among the Young Kingdoms.
	
	Not all of the Myyrrhn have wings. Roll a d6; a result of 3-6 means that he or she is winged, and can fly. Those without wings yearn for them, seek magic and knowledge to find them, and are not consoled that they can run slightly faster, at 35 feet per round, than can their winged brethren.
	
	The Myyrrhn are adept at sorcery, and necromancers are known among them. Myyrrhn folk who fly do not use horses; wingless Myyrrhn can use horses. They prefer not to wear metal armor, and for winged Myyrrhn especially there are practical limits to the weight of armor that they can wear. Wingless members often wear stylized wings.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Alignment and Religion</b>: Generally most Myyrrhn worship Lassa, Lady of the Air, an Elemental Lord. But they are welcome to worship other air-based deities.<br /><br />
	
	<b>Adventurers</b>: Finally, why has this person left the safety of the aerie to go out into a potentially hostile world? Does she wish to travel the four corners of the Young Kingdoms? Did he feel restricted by the insular Myyrrhn society? Does she feel a need to prove herself in the eyes of her family? Did he break a tribal law? If he or she has no wings, the goal of adventuring is clear. <br /><br />
